# Chaos Monkey Team - CPU Stress Testing

## Overview

This repository contains the `cpustress.py` script used by the Chaos Monkey Team to conduct CPU stress tests on a Flask application server. The primary goal is to assess server resilience and performance under high load conditions.

## Script: cpustress.py

The `cpustress.py` script is designed to continuously send HTTP requests to stress the server. It supports various HTTP methods, including POST, PUT, and DELETE.

### Features of the Script

- **Continuous Request Loop**: To maximize stress on the server.
- **Support for Various HTTP Methods**: Including POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- **Threading**: Simulates concurrent access by multiple users.

### Usage Instructions

1. Ensure Python 3.x and the `requests` library are installed on your machine.
2. Modify the `base_url` in the script to point to your Flask application's URL.
3. Adjust the `stress_endpoints` to target specific endpoints of your application.
4. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python3 cpustress.py
   ```
````

5. Monitor your server's performance during the test.

## Chaos Monkey Team Tasks

1. **CPU Utilization Monitoring**: Use the script to increase CPU utilization on Flask servers and observe changes in metrics.
2. **Network Traffic Simulation**: Simulate heavy network traffic for creating and retrieving todo lists and todos.
3. **Endpoint Stress Testing**: Increase HTTP requests to different endpoints (creating, updating, deleting todos) and monitor server response.
