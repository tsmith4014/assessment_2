### 1. Load Testing Script (Python)

- **URL**: Replace `"http://your-flask-app-url/"` with the URL of your Flask application.
- **Requests and Threads**: Adjust `request_per_thread` and `num_threads` based on your desired load level. The current settings are just placeholders.

### 2. Stress Testing Script (Python)

- **URL**: As in the load testing script, use the URL of your Flask application.
- **Requests and Threads**: Increase `request_per_thread` and `num_threads` significantly to simulate stress conditions. Determine these values based on your system's expected capacity.

### 3. Service Failure and Recovery Testing (Shell Script)

- **Service Name**: Replace `name-of-your-service` with the actual service name you want to stop and start. This could be your web server service like `nginx` or `apache2`, or a database service like `mysql`.

### 4. Database Stress Testing (Shell Script)

This example uses Sysbench for MySQL. If you're using a different database, you'll need a different approach.

- **Host, User, Password, Database**: Replace `your-db-host`, `your-user`, `your-password`, and `your-db` with your actual database host, user credentials, and database name.
- **Configuration**: The parameters like `--table-size`, `--tables`, `--threads`, and `--time` should be adjusted according to your testing requirements and database size.

### General Adjustments:

- **Environment Specifics**: Replace placeholders with actual values pertinent to your environment (e.g., server names, paths, URLs).
- **Permission and Access**: Ensure the scripts have the necessary permissions to execute, especially on production or shared environments. For shell scripts, you might need `sudo` privileges.
- **Safety and Testing Environment**: Always first test in a controlled, non-production environment to avoid unintended disruptions or data loss.
- **Monitoring Integration**: If you have specific metrics or logs to capture during testing, ensure your scripts or monitoring tools are set up to track these.

Remember, these scripts are starting points. Depending on your project's complexity and specific needs, you might need to add additional logic, error handling, or customization. Always review and test scripts in a safe environment before using them in your actual project setup.

## 1. Load Testing Script (Python)

This script simulates high traffic on your Flask application.

```python
import requests
import threading

def send_request(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        print(f"Response: {response.status_code}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Request failed: {e}")

def simulate_load(url, request_per_thread, num_threads):
    threads = []
    for _ in range(num_threads):
        thread = threading.Thread(target=lambda: [send_request(url) for _ in range(request_per_thread)])
        threads.append(thread)
        thread.start()

    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

simulate_load("http://your-flask-app-url/", 100, 10)  # Adjust URL and numbers as needed
```

### 2. Stress Testing Script (Python)

Similar to the load testing script, but with increased numbers to simulate stress conditions.

```python
# Use the same script as above but with increased 'request_per_thread' and 'num_threads'
simulate_load("http://your-flask-app-url/", 1000, 50)  # Adjust these values for stress testing
```

### 3. Service Failure and Recovery Testing (Shell Script)

This script stops and restarts a service on your server.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

SERVICE_NAME="name-of-your-service"

# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop $SERVICE_NAME
echo "Service $SERVICE_NAME stopped."

# Wait for 1 minute
sleep 60

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl start $SERVICE_NAME
echo "Service $SERVICE_NAME restarted."
```

### 4. Database Stress Testing (Python with Sysbench)

Note: Sysbench should be installed and configured. This is a basic command to run Sysbench. It's a placeholder as Sysbench usage varies based on the database configuration.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Sysbench commands for MySQL
sysbench /usr/share/sysbench/oltp_read_write.lua --mysql-host=your-db-host --mysql-user=your-user --mysql-password=your-password --mysql-db=your-db --table-size=100000 --tables=10 prepare
sysbench /usr/share/sysbench/oltp_read_write.lua --mysql-host=your-db-host --mysql-user=your-user --mysql-password=your-password --mysql-db=your-db --table-size=100000 --tables=10 --threads=10 --time=60 run
sysbench /usr/share/sysbench/oltp_read_write.lua --mysql-host=your-db-host --mysql-user=your-user --mysql-password=your-password --mysql-db=your-db cleanup
```

### 5. Network Failure Simulation

This requires AWS Fault Injection Simulator and cannot be scripted as it involves AWS console or AWS CLI configurations.

### General Guidelines:

- Always test in a controlled environment first.
- Ensure you have permission and that it's safe to run these tests, especially in a shared or production-like environment.
- Adjust parameters like URLs, service names, thread counts, and request counts to suit your environment.

These scripts provide a starting point for your testing. Depending on your specific infrastructure and requirements, you may need to further customize or expand upon these scripts.
